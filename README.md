    My Neovim Configuration
</h1>

* Current configuration provides LSP and debugger capabilities for JS/TS, Zig, C/C++ and Lua
* Code highlighting with [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) for all supported languages
* Modified [Catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim) theme for true color terminals, custom 16-color theme for other terminals
* Custom [ZLS](https://github.com/zigtools/zls) package for [Mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim), which fetches latest ZLS version from ```master``` branch (instead of stable release version from Mason registry)
* Targeted mainly on Neovim nightly, may or may not work on older versions
